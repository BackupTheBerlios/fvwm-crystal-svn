What to do, what to do...

- put Crystal into GNU Arch server, and make possible to create .deb, .ebuild,
  .rpm and .tar.gz packages using only version available from GNU Arch.

- we should create some replacement for 'wallpaper-changer'. I think about
  some kind of app/script which will be able to set/select wallpapers more
  cleverly. It can save it's settings in ~/.fvwm/ but I prefer to use/create
  a standalone application for this purpuose.

- check configuration files and documentation and remove spelling errors and
  such. I know that my English sucks :)

- Write documentation!

- there is a problem with FvwmIconMan and anti-aliased TTF fonts, they are
  visible only at 2/3 height of normal text, at least on my fvwm installation,
  anoyne else has this? When I switch to normale X fonts, all is ok, and in
  other places such as titlebars everything is ok... How to get rid of that
  thing?

- make new version of webpage, old sucks. It should be simplier and brighter.

- Create a generator for '~/.fvwm/ApplicationPanel'. I don't have a good idea
  how it should look like...

- add more apps to '~/.fvwm/Docklet', check existing ones.

- add new icons and Styles

- get new icons for main panel buttons, and maybe menu entries?
- change titlebar buttons (images)?

- create some more panel sets.
